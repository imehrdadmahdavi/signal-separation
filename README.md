## Signal Separation

### Description

This project uses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to retrieve original signals from three observations each of which contains a different mix of the original signals.

### Install

This project implemented using **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries:

- [Jupyter Notebook (IPython) 4.10.0](https://ipython.org/)
- [numPy 1.16.4](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas 0.24.2](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib 2.2.4](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn 0.17](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)


### Code

The code is provided in the `signal-separation.ipynb` notebook file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `signal-separation/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook signal-separation.ipynb
```  

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

There are three WAVE files, each of which is a mix.
